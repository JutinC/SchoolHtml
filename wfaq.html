                        <div>
                            <p>It can work in many rough surfaces as long as it is in an open
                                area to form the house. Hills and mountains can work.</p>

                    <summary>Can it accidentally open?</summary>
                        <div>
                            <p>No because you have to push the ears in and then out and
                                that kind of motion is unlikely to open up. It also refuses to open
                                in spaces that cannot accomodate it which makes it impossible to accidentally
                                open.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>You simply go to the back of the house, push in the ears on each of
                            the corners in the back. It will not activate if any lifeforms are
                            inside. If any unwanted insects get in, they will be forced out but
                            nothing happens if there are any pets or people inside.</p>
